                    <b> Documentation of Individual Tech Requirements: </b> I learned how to use functions in jquery and implement it in my drag and drop planner. In addition, I now fully understand how databases work as I incorporated it in my group's feedback database and page. I came into this class very very little programming knowledge but through the year, my interest for computer science has increased more and more. I am definitely taking CSA next year!

                    <b> Current Project Overview and Plans: </b> The website at the moment is a study tools website that is focused on helping students with various tools that they can use. Our website provides a variety of features including planners, timers, math functions, notes, etc. This website allows the user to have lots of user interface action and be able to be more productive especially for college students. Most of the trimester we have had this our local Intellij but we have deployed to have it on the main website as well. Our sponsor is a UCSD professor and hope that eventually he can give this too his students to perhaps use it in the future.

                    <b>Individual Grading (4.65/5): </b> I worked on good features this trimester such as the drag and drop planner. However, I didn't start working on databases until the last few weeks which led to me only being able to create the feedbakc databse and help on the notes databse. However, I now fully understand the databse structures and how to ocnfigure them. I think this is the coolest and most valuable thing I learned this year. I went through the whole troubleshooting mode and learned a lot from it. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my performance in this class and will be persuing CSA next year.
                    <br>
                    <b>Team Grading (4.8/5): </b> My team worked really well together getting all our features done for our project. We helped each other brainstorm for ideas and make sure our project's main purpose was present and connected with all the features. We helped each other troubleshoot and did a great jon at N@TM. The only problem was that we started working on databases pretty late.
