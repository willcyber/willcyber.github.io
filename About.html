        <p>Hi Preemadonnas!

          My name is Zoya, and Iâ€™m a student studying Computer Science at NC State University with a double minor in Cognitive Science and Art and Design. I was a junior in high school when I received the amazing opportunity to intern for Preemadonna. I designed and developed many of the main pages of Nail the Code, and I also illustrated the default hand and nails youâ€™ll be working with when you design your manicure! My internship experience is a big part of why I chose to major in CS as I entered the world of front-end development. Itâ€™s a space where art meets tech, combining both creativity and problem solving skills as you can approach coding problems from a designerâ€™s perspective. Nail the Code communicates that idea as you can create your own personalized manicure while coding it yourself - for that reason, getting to help create the site aligned with my passions. I think it will really show programmers of all ages that you can code anything you imagine. Plus, Nail the Code is a great place to create designs you can print with the Nailbot later (I brainstormed countless designs when I was working on the site ðŸ˜‰)!    </p>
